# STEM Robotics Progress Tracker Platform – Project Roadmap
Created by: Kelvin Edet Udoh (@kelvin101udoh-art)

## 🎯 Project Purpose
To build a digital platform that captures hands-on learning during robotics and science club activities. The system tracks problem-solving, design thinking, creativity, teamwork and persistence — providing insights to instructors, parents and students.

## 🧩 Core Features (MVP)
- Student learning profiles
- Weekly robotics activity tracking
- Behavioural + cognitive skill indicators
- Robot build logs (with photos)
- Instructor dashboard
- Parent-friendly summaries

## 🚀 Future Features
- AI-generated session summaries
- Automatic learning milestone detection
- Exportable student portfolios
- Mobile-first UI
- Club-wide analytics
- Collaboration features for teachers

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- Next.js
- Supabase
- PostgreSQL
- TailwindCSS

## 🔍 Research + Academic Background
This project is part of Kelvin’s academic work at Middlesex University and is inspired by his experience teaching at RoboThink Edutainment.

## 📅 Development Timeline
