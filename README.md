# stem-robotics-progress-tracker-platform
A digital learning tracker built by Kelvin Edet Udoh to capture student progress, creativity, engineering skills, and problem-solving in robotics and science clubs. Inspired by real teaching experience at RoboThink Edutainment.

STEM Robotics Progress Tracker Platform

Developed by Kelvin Edet Udoh (@kelvin101udoh-art), this EdTech project is designed to transform how robotics and STEM clubs capture student learning. The platform documents hands-on skills such as engineering design, coding creativity, teamwork, problem-solving and persistence — areas traditional assessments often overlook.

Inspired by my work as a STEM Robotics Instructor at RoboThink Edutainment, the project blends educational technology, UX design, MIS principles and real teaching experience to create a system that makes STEM learning more measurable, visible and meaningful.
